Welcome to the Infection Monkey documenation hub!

## What is Infection Monkey?

The Infection Monkey is an open source security tool for testing a data center's resiliency to perimeter breaches and internal server infection. The Monkey uses various methods to self propagate across a data center and reports success to a centralized Monkey Island Command and Control server.

The Infection Monkey is comprised of two parts:

* Monkey - A tool which infects other machines and propagates to them
* Monkey Island - A dedicated UI to visualize the Infection Monkey's progress inside the data center
