Description: Guardicore Infection Monkey Island installation package
# Dependency        Why is it required
# openssl           Server certificate generation
# python3.7-dev     Server runtime
# python3.7-venv    For creating virtual env to install all the server pip deps (don't want to pollute system python)
# python3-venv      python3.7-venv doesn't work without it since you need ensure-pip
# build-essential   for compiling python dependencies that don't come in a pre-compiled wheel, like `netifaces`
Depends: openssl, python3.7-dev, python3.7-venv, python3-venv, build-essential
